    1. Login to the jumpbox using your user name from Lab 6. Change the password using the passwd
    command to a password that exists in the password list.

    2. Use your existing user name as the user to brute for passwords. Depending on the tool, this may
    mean creating a “list” file of one user or providing the user name on the command line.
